# UrbanSoundClassificationusingML - Experiment 2

For the images there are 2 folders that I kept.  The folder firstrun deals with the initial running of the model with mutiple datasets and multiple 
inputs from the batch size between 16 and 32, the number of epochs, the number of drop neurons, and the number of neurons to build the model with.

After the first run, analysis was done on the results to pick the best combinations of the parameters for the model.  The second folder contains 
the results of narrowed down tests mainly with 

neurons at 128 and 64 
dropping % between .2 and .4
batch size between 16 and 32
epochs between 150 and 200
